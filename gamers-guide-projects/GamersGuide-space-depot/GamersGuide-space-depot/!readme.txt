Description: Space Depot Hunt is a combination crossword puzzle riddle and hidden object game. The goal 
of the game is to match one-sentence riddles with objects strewn about a cluttered space depot. The player 
is awarded points with each correct answer; points are removed for each incorrect answer. Riddles come from 
popular culture, especially science fiction.

Demonstrates: Slide out panel using CSS transitions; animated opening (partial splash screen); synchronized 
sound effects; data storage and retrieval from hidden text; random number generation and shuffling of arrays; 
“hot spots” using invisible DIV elements; timed play.

To play: On game load, instructions appear beside a “host” robot; click on the robot to begin. Open the slide 
out panel by clicking on the arrow along the top. Select a riddle, then click on the corresponding object 
in the space depot. Sound effects indicate if the selection is correct or incorrect. The game ends when 
all of the riddles have been correctly matched.
