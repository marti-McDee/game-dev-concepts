Bonus games are primarily designed as a teaching tool rather than as ready-to-go commercial games. They are 
functional examples of creating 2D games using bitmap graphics, so you can easily change and update them. The latest
version of Google Chrome is recommended as the development platform. All code and art is included. Consider them 
as springboards for your own unique creations. Refer to comments in the code.

Level: 2 
Supported Interface: keyboard, touchscreen

Help Sharker reach the other side of the road so he can eat the annoying people there. Oh, and watch out 
for passing cars! The graphics are designed with an intentional "8-bit" pixelization look.

sharker-Lesson1 – Basic layout of the game board and primary pieces: road: one car, and shark. Red lines 
are used to visually mark the roads the cars will travel over.

sharker-Lesson2 – As above, but with CSS transitions added to animate additional cars on the road.

sharker-Lesson3 – As above, but with animated shark swimming. Click the up/down/left/right keyboard arrow 
keys to move the shark over the game board. Graphics added of humans on the other side of the highway.

sharker-Lesson4 – Full version with all animation. Added collision detection: shark spins and returns 
to the bottom if hit by a car. U/D/L/R sharks teeth buttons along the top right are hot spots that 
replicate keyboard control. Help button displays a pop-up help screen.
