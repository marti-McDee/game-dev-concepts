Bonus games are primarily designed as a teaching tool rather than as ready-to-go commercial games. They are 
functional examples of creating 2D games using bitmap graphics, so you can easily change and update them. The latest
version of Google Chrome is recommended as the development platform. All code and art is included. Consider them 
as springboards for your own unique creations. Refer to comments in the code.
