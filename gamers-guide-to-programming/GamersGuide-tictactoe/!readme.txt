Classic tic-tac-toe game, played between two human players. There are five lessons of the game, each one 
building off the other.

TicTacToe-Lesson1 – Rudimentary game example with click events for placing X and O in a 3x3 HTML table grid. 
No scoring.

TicTacToe-Lesson2 – Enhanced lesson version of the basic game, with styles used to format the table. 
Game keeps track of score, and announces if X or O is the winner.

TicTacToe-Lesson3 – As above, but with INPUT buttons. The HTML table is not used; placement of the buttons 
is dependent on style properties.

TicTacToe-Lesson4 – As above, but with New Game feature. Clicking this button demonstrates resetting 
all game variables to their initial values.
