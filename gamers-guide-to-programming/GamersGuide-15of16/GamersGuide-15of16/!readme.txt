functional examples of creating 2D games using bitmap graphics, so you can easily change and update them. The latest

uses numbered tiles, and another that uses picture tiles.

15of16-Lesson1 – Game play with numbered buttons. No graphics are used.

a picture at random from four preset images. You can substitute your own images.
