Bonus games are primarily designed as a teaching tool rather than as ready-to-go commercial games. They are 
functional examples of creating 2D games using bitmap graphics, so you can easily change and update them. The latest
version of Google Chrome is recommended as the development platform. All code and art is included. Consider them 
as springboards for your own unique creations. Refer to comments in the code.

Level: 1
Supported Interface: mouse, touchscreen

Description: Color Puzzle displays a set of six colored squares. The colors are randomized across the spectrum, 
though coding in the game restricts the colors to a more narrow subset of hues. You can modify the spectral 
spread -- the entire rainbow of colors, or just finely differentiated hues of the same color -- by editing 
the code. The goal of the game is to click on each color, and move that color to the blank squares above, 
in spectrum order.

Demonstrates: Click (or tap) events; using a third-party JavaScript library (rainbowvis.js, included) for 
generating the color hues; data storage in arrays; array element comparison; working with and manipulating 
CSS RGB color values.

To play: Click on a color square in the bottom row. Then click on an empty square in the top row to move 
the color to that square.
