Description: Pipeworks is a timed puzzle game. The goal is to connect one or more water spigots on the left 
side of the pipe room, to one or more drains on the right side. The player can choose from among four types 
of pipe to construct the pathways. At the start of the game, the number and placement of spigots and drains, 
as well as the position of interfering walls, is set at random.

Demonstrates: JavaScript drag-and-drop interface using the mouse (as such, this game is not playable on a 
touch screen); random number generation; image transform manipulation (picture rotation); division of game 
area into discrete play squares; logic for placing a game piece into a play square (but only if it matches 
certain criteria); timed play.

To play: Drag a pipe piece from a "pipe well" on the right wall into the play board. The pipe must connect 
from another another pipe. As needed, click the arrow button beside the pipe well to rotate the pipe into 
the proper orientation before dragging. If you make a mistake, you can undo the pipe drop. Undo is limited 
to the last turn only.
